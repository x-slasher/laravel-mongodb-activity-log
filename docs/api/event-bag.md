This class will carry changes over the user defined pipes via `handle` method and will have these properties:

```php
// Event Name
public string $event,

// Model in question
public Model $model,

// changes array
public array $changes,

// current applied options
public ?LogOptions $options = null
```

Please don't attempt to change the model inside the event since it may result in unexpected results or miss with the logs.
